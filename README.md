# kineticstoolkit_emg

Functions to open EMG data into Kinetics Toolkit (experimental)

This extension provides the function `read_delsys_csv` that reads a CSV file exported from Delsys Trigno converter and loads it as a bunch of TimeSeries.

This is very experimental at the moment and the function may disappear in a near future.
